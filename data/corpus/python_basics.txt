# Sample Python Documentation

## Python Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development.

## Key Features

- **Easy to Learn**: Python has a simple, clean syntax that emphasizes readability
- **High-level Language**: Python abstracts away many low-level details
- **Interpreted**: Python code is executed line by line, making debugging easier
- **Object-Oriented**: Python supports object-oriented programming paradigms
- **Large Standard Library**: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library
- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables can change types during runtime

## Basic Syntax

```python
# Variables and basic types
name = "Python"
version = 3.11
is_awesome = True

# Functions
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Classes
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b
    
    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b
```

## Data Structures

Python provides several built-in data structures:

- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections
- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections  
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements

## Use Cases

Python is widely used in:
- Web development (Django, Flask)
- Data science and machine learning
- Automation and scripting
- Scientific computing
- Artificial intelligence
