# Machine Learning Overview

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
The algorithm learns from labeled training data, making predictions based on that data.

Examples:
- Classification: Email spam detection, image recognition
- Regression: House price prediction, stock market forecasting

### Unsupervised Learning
The algorithm finds patterns in data without labeled responses.

Examples:
- Clustering: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection
- Dimensionality Reduction: Data visualization, feature extraction

### Reinforcement Learning
The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Examples:
- Game playing (Chess, Go)
- Robotics control
- Autonomous driving

## Key Concepts

- **Training Data**: The dataset used to train the model
- **Features**: Input variables used for predictions
- **Labels**: Output variables we want to predict
- **Model**: The mathematical representation of patterns in data
- **Overfitting**: When model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- **Underfitting**: When model is too simple to capture underlying patterns

## Common Algorithms

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
